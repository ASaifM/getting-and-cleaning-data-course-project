# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
This is the third project of the specialization. There is only one
script to run which is run_analysis.R. You should make sure once
you download the project that there exists a folder called
'UCI HAR Dataset', which is the extracted folder of the assignment
starting files, that contains the raw data for the script. To run
the script, open RStudio and navigate the script directory and type:

source('run_analysis.R')

A description of the variables used in the
cleaned up data can be found in CodeBook.md.

The final cleaned-up data can be found in this repository as tidy.csv.
